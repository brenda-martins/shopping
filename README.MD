# Loja Virtual 

Simple online store that I used to apply some of my knowledge

PS Online store was the simplest context I found, but the code used here can be used on any system (such as structured login or a simple crud)



# Reason

This project is part of my personal portfolio. My intention is to improve my programming logic, so i will be very happy with any feedback on the algorithm or code structure, after all we always have something to learn or something to improve...
